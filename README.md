# GameSparta
Create a game in a week @ Sparta Global

# Sparta Core Project 1

Our task is to produce a project using any and all of the technology that we have learnt within the past two weeks ; HTML, CSS, Javascript.

>**You must successfully pass this project in order to graduate the Sparta Academy**

## Task

Build a **browser based game!**

**The choice of game was totally up to us however we had to ensure our project idea was approved by our trainer.**

Our game must:

* Include an instruction section explaining how to play the game.
* Ether display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
* Be styled to perfection!
* Be hosted online!
* Your game should include a leaderboard
* Your game should be 2 player

**BONUS**

* Our game could be played against the computer...
* We could include some fancy animations in your game...
* We could look into HTML5 Audio and include some snazzy sound effects...

**ReadMe**
We MUST have a detailed readme.md file documenting the entire project including a section detailing how to get the app up and running.

An example of a good project readme, written by Matt Calthrop (A previous Sparta Trainer) can be found here: https://github.com/mcalthrop/angular-spa-demo


---
**Presentation**
We will be required to prepare a small 5 minute presentation based around our project. This will be followed by a 5 minute Q&A.


## File Structure

We had to make sure that you're file structure is setup appropriately. Separate out all your Javascript, Css and images into their own independent files. e.i.

```
+-- project-one
|	+--js
|		--main.js
|	+--css
|		--style.css
|	+--images
|	--index.html
```

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to:

* To pull everything together by building a small web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.
* To demonstrate the quality of communication around your decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.

We worked **individually** for this project!




#### Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.**

* **Wireframes.**

* **Milestones.**


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-commented. Will anyone else quickly understand what is going on in your application?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Fully git tracked with dev and master branches with your trainers added as collaborators with an acceptable amount of git comments.

Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* How you work together as a team.
* How you support yourself and each other to achieve a common goal.
